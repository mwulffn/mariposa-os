The AUTOCONFIG mechanism used for the Zorro III bus is an extension of the
original Zorro II configuration mechanism.  The main reason for this is
that the Zorro II mechanism works so well, there was little need to change
anything.  The changes are simply support for new hardware features on the
Zorro III bus.

Amiga autoconfiguration is surprisingly simple.  When an Amiga powers up
or resets, every card in the system goes to its unconfigured state.  At
this point, the most important signals in the system are  /CFGINn  and
 /CFGOUTn .  As long as a card's  /CFGINn  line is negated, that card sits
quietly and does nothing on the bus (though memory cards should continue
to refresh even through reset, and any local board activities that don't
concern the bus may take place after  /RESET  is negated). As part of the
unconfigured state,  /CFGOUTn  is negated by the PIC immediately on reset.

The configuration process begins when a card's  /CFGINn  line is asserted,
either by the backplane, if it's the first slot, or via the configuration
chain, if it's a later card.  The configuration chain simply ensures that
only one unconfigured card will see an asserted  /CFGINn  at one time.  An
unconfigured card that sees its  /CFGINn  line asserted will respond to a
block of memory called configuration space. In this block, the PIC will
assert a set of read-only registers, followed by a set of write-only
registers (the read-only registers are also known as AUTOCONFIG ROM).
Starting at the base of this block, the read registers describe the
device's size, type, and other requirements.  The operating system reads
these, and based on them, decides what should be written to the board.
Some write information is optional, but a board will always be assigned a
base address or be told to shut up.  The act of writing the final bit of
base address, or writing anything to a shutup address, will cause the PIC
to assert its  /CFGOUTn , enabling the next board in the configuration
chain.

The Zorro II configuration space is the 64K memory block $00E8xxxx, which
of course is driven with 16-bit Zorro II cycles; all Zorro II cards
configure there.  The Zorro III configuration space is the 64K memory
block beginning at $FF00xxxx, which is always driven with 32-bit Zorro III
cycles (PICs need only decode  A31-A24  during configuration).  A Zorro III
PIC can configure in Zorro II or Zorro III configuration space, at the
designer's discretion, but not both at once. All read registers physically
return only the top 4 bits of data, on  D31-D28  for either bus mode. Write
registers are written to support nybble, byte, and word registers for the
same register, again based on what works best in hardware.  This design
attempts to map into real hardware as simply as possible. Every AUTOCONFIG
register is logically considered to be 8 bits wide; the 8 bits actually
being nybbles from two paired addresses.

               Figure K-17: Configuration Register Mapping


The register mappings for the two different blocks are shown in Figure
K-17. All the bit patterns mentioned in the following sections are logical
values. To avoid ambiguity, all registers are referred to by the number of
the first register in the pair, since the first pair member is the same
for both mapping schemes. In the actual implementation of these registers,
all read registers except for the 00 register are physically complemented;
eg, the logical value of register 3C is always 0, which means in hardware,
the upper nybbles of locations $00E8003C and $00E8003E, or $FF00003C and
$FF00013C, both return all 1s.



The actual register assignments are below.  Most of the registers are the
same as for the Zorro II bus, and are included here for completeness.  The
Amiga OS software names for these registers in the ExpansionRom or
ExpansionControl structures are included.

                      5       If this bit is set, the PIC's memory will
                              be linked into the system free pool.  The
                              Zorro III register 08 may modify the size
                              of the linked memory.

                      4       Setting this bit tells the OS to read an
                              autoboot ROM.

                      3       This bit is set to indicate that the next
                              board is related to this one; often
                              logically separate PICs are physically
                              located on the same card.

                      2-0     These bits indicate the configuration size
                              of the PIC.  This size can be modified for
                              the Zorro III cards by the size extension
                              bit, which is the new meaning of bit 5 in
                              register 08.

                              products, to help in identification of
                              system cards, and it must be unique between
                              devices using the automatic driver binding
                              features.

08     0A     108     7       This was originally an indicator to place

                              when set, or anywhere it'll fit, if
                              cleared.  Under the Zorro III spec, this is
                              set to indicate that the board is basically
                              a memory device, cleared to indicate that
                              the board is basically an I/O device.

                      6       This bit is set to indicate that the board
                              can't be shut up by software, cleared to
                              indicate that the board can be shut up.

                      5       This is the size extension bit.  If
                              cleared, the size bits in register 00 mean
                              the same as under Zorro II, if set, the
                              size bits indicate a new size. The most
                              common new Zorro III sizes are the smaller
                              ones; all new sized cards get aligned on
                              their natural boundaries.

                      4       Reserved, must be 1 for all Zorro III cards.

                      3-0     These bits indicate a board's sub-size; the
                              amount of memory actually required by a
                              PIC.  For memory boards that auto-link,
                              this is the actual amount of memory that
                              will be linked into the system free memory
                              pool. A memory card, with memory starting
                              at the base address, can be automatically
                              sized by the Operating System.  This
                              sub-size option is intended to support
                              cards with variable setups without
                              requiring variable physical configuration
                              capability on such cards.  It also may
                              greatly simplify a Zorro III design, since
                              16-megabyte cards and up can be designed
                              with a single latch and comparator for base
                              address matching, while 8 megabyte and
                              smaller PICs require large latch/comparator
                              circuits not available in standard TTL
                              packages.

                              For boards that wish to be automatically
                              sized by the operating system, a few rules
                              apply.  The memory is sized in 512K
                              increments, and grows from the base address
                              upward.  Memory wraps are detected, but the
                              design must insure that its data bus
                              doesn't float when the sizing routine
                              addresses memory locations that aren't
                              physically present on the board; data bus
                              pullups or pulldowns are recommended.  This
                              feature is designed to allow boards to be

                                Reg   Nybble     Byte
                                ---   ------     ----
                                46    A27-A24    N/A
                                44    A31-A28    A31-A24
                                4A    A19-A16    N/A
                                48    A23-A20    A23-A16

                              Note that writing to register 48 actually
                              configures the board for both Zorro II and
                              Zorro III boards in the Zorro II
                              configuration block.  For Zorro III PICs in
                              the Zorro III configuration block, the
                              action is slightly different. The software
                              will actually write the configuration as
                              byte and word wide accesses:

                                Reg   Byte       Word
                                ---   ----       ----
                                48    A23-A16    N/A
                                44    A31-A24    A31-A16

                              The actual configuration takes place when
                              register 44 is written, thus supporting any
                              physical size of configuration register.

--     (ec_Shutup)            written to 4C will cause a board that
                              supports shut-up to completely disappear
                              until the next reset.

 *  The original Zorro specifications called for a few registers, like
    these, that remained active after configuration.  Support for this is
    impossible, since the configuration registers generally disappear
    when a board is configured, and absolutely must move out of the
    $00E8xxxx space.  So since these couldn't really be implemented in
    hardware, system software has never supported them.  They're included
    here for historical purposes.
